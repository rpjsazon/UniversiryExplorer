# University Explorer Guide
## Bootcamp Project 1

In this project we were tasked with creating a website from scratch which incorprates the use of two third-party API's, The User story was to be decided in our group.

## User Story
* As a prospective university student i would like to be able to search a website to find a chosen university.
* When selecting my chosen university i am presented with a map displaying the university and the surrounding area.
* This map also shows me selectable points near by that i can interact with.

This app uses advanced JavaScript utilising JSON and JQuery, CSS with Bootstrap, HTML as well as the integration of third party API's.

The API's used for this app are the HipoUni api and OpenTrip
